Given that a user opens the application in the browser When the user navigates to the home page Then the photo gallery should display all of the images in the gallery

How are we implementing it?
Use AJAX, specifically $.ajax(), to read the provided JSON file.
Each object should become a new instance of a constructor function. Refer to the data to determine the necessary properties.
Use jQuery to make a copy of the HTML template of the photo component. For each object, fill in the duplicated template with its properties, then append the copy to the DOM.
